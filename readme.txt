[2017 CapstoneDesign 2 - SOFA]


 Our Project 'SOSfinder' is an IoT security web service. It is a service that diagnoses the vulnerability of this device by checking user's IoT device developed by open source software. It is intended for power users who are familiar with firmware or programming.

 There are two functions.

 1. Diagnostics of IoT devices
 2. Board for making security community.

 The source code for features completed in the first semester can be found in the 'src' folder.
